# UNIBIT-assignment-round



## Code Explanation ##

The unibit class contains several methods to perform operations on arrays and find combination pairs based on the target value.

<h3>firstCombinationPairs(int[] arr, int target)</h3>

This method finds all pairs in the given array arr whose sum or difference is equal to the target value. It returns a 2D array of pairs.

<h3>mergeSortedArray(int[][] arr)</h3>

This method merges all the subarrays from the input 2D array arr into a single sorted array. It returns a 1D array.

<h3>seComPair(int[] nums, int target)<h3>

This method finds all combinations of numbers from the sorted array nums that sum up to the target value. It uses a recursive backtracking approach and returns a 2D array of combinations.

<h3?>doubleTargetValue(int target)</h3>
This method doubles the target value and returns the result.

<h3>main(String[] args)<h3>
The main method is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the usage of the above methods by performing the following steps:

Define an input array nums and a target value.
Find the first combination pairs using firstCombinationPairs method and print the result.
Merge the pairs into a single array using mergeSortedArray method and print the result.
Double the target value using doubleTargetValue method and print the result.
Find the second combination pairs using seComPair method with the doubled target value and print the result.
This code provides functionality to find combination pairs and perform operations on arrays. It can be used as a starting point for further development or as a reference for understanding the concepts and techniques used in the code.
